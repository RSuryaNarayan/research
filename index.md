## About me 
---
<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I am a second year Ph.D. Student at the [Computational Reactive Flow and Energy Lab](https://crfel.umn.edu/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities directed [Prof.Suo Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/me/suo-yang). I extensively work with the [Pele suite of codes](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/) to conduct Direct Numerical Simulations, enabling fundamental studies of Turbulent Combustion, Detonations and Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT). At CRFEL, I work in close collaboration with [ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/) on aspects concerning reactor explosion safety and predicitive design and mitigation. In our recent effort, we aim to further understand the influence of catalytic walls on the impact of flame acceleration in microchannels. 

My undergraduate journey at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli has been quite rewarding and fun. I started out working on rarefied gas-flows and reacting gas-dynamics with [Prof.Satheesh K](https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/satheeshk) at [Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/aboutus/institute) for 6 months, building [CHEMOC](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/CHEMOC) (this doesn't work completely) and [high-temperature EoS solvers](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/High-Temperature-Gas-Dynamics). I love developing CFD codes and coded up [INTENSE](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/INT--E--NSE), a 2-d structured grid Navier-Stokes solver during undergrad. I also had the chance to intern over the Summer of 2021 during my undergraduate studies at ExxonMobil Upstream research and Development, Bengaluru Tech Center, India. Subsequently, I worked at the [FLAME lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), Indian Institute of Science, alongside [Prof.Konduri Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/name/konduri-aditya/) for an year. Feel free to hit me up for a conversation on anything involving fluids, combustion, energy and computing. 

I play badminton in my free time. I am an ardent fan of Carnatic Classical music (learnt till Gitams, starting out on Varnams and Kritis). However, I subscribe to a broad genre of songs spanning Carnatic classical music, Pop, Rock to Western Classical. I also love cooking dishes. I've cooked Indian (so far, a healthy mix of Tamil and North Indian food), Italian (mostly alfredo), Mexican and Thai so far.  

## Research Interests
---
I get piqued by:
1. Turbulent combustion- algorithms for numerical methods/code development/ diagnostics on large scale datasets, specifically at high/supercritical pressure
2. Detonations- both applied research (RDEs, Explosion safety, DDT) and fundamental (cell structure, stability, pocket burning, transverse waves etc.)
3. Hypersonic reacting flows- to enable >Mach 6 flight via ramjets, scramjets, shcramjets etc..
4. Reduced Order Modelling - LES/RANS closure development, Spectral methods, Manifold-based methods, Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, Autoencoder etc.), Neural ODEs/PDEs, PINNS etc.
5. High-performance computing- heterogeneous computing, hybrid (CPU/CPU, CPU/GPU) computations to accelerate simulations
