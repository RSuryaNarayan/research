## About me 
---
<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I am an Incoming Ph.D. Student at the [Computational Reactive Flow and Energy Lab](https://crfel.umn.edu/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities directed [Prof.Suo Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/me/suo-yang). Previously, I worked at the [FLAME lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), Indian Institute of Science, alongside [Prof.Konduri Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/name/konduri-aditya/) during my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I extensively work with the [Pele suite of codes](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/) to conduct Direct Numerical Simulations of Turbulent Combustion. Previously, I also worked on rarefied gas-flows and reacting gas-dynamics with [Prof.Satheesh K](https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/satheeshk) at [Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/aboutus/institute) for 6 months, building [CHEMOC](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/CHEMOC) and [high-temperature EoS solvers](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/High-Temperature-Gas-Dynamics). I am also a freelance CFD code developer and maintain [INTENSE](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/INT--E--NSE), a 2-d structured grid Navier-Stokes solver.

## Research Interests
---
I get piqued by:
1. Turbulent combustion- algorithms for numerical methods/code development/ diagnostics on large scale datasets
2. Hypersonic reacting flows- rarefied external flows and scramjet propulsion
3. High-performance computing- CPU/GPU/TPU hybrid computations to accelerate simulations  
4. Machine Learning to accelerate CFD
5. Reduced order modelling (ROM)/Surrogate Modelling
