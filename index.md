## About me 

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I am a final year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the areas of computational methods using HPC architechtures. I am currently working as a visiting student researcher at [Computational Reactive Flows and Energy Lab](https://crfel.umn.edu/) in collaboration with [Prof.Suo Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/me/suo-yang), the Univerisity of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Minneapolis, USA. We are working on obtaining fundamental insights on cool/warm flame dynamics under supercritical turbulent conditions using large scale Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) leveraging the [Pele suite of codes](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/). Paralelly, I am also engaged with the [FLAME lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), Indian Institute of Science, alongside [Prof.Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/name/konduri-aditya/) on a project involving non-premixed flame dynamics in dual-mode ramjet engines. Previously, I worked on rarefied gas-flows and reacting gas-dynamics with [Prof.Satheesh K](https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/satheeshk) at [Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/aboutus/institute) for 6 months, building [CHEMOC](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/CHEMOC) and [high-temperature EOS solvers](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/High-Temperature-Gas-Dynamics). I am also a freelance CFD code developer and maintain [INTENSE](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/INT--E--NSE), a 2-d structured grid Navier-Stokes solver.
