## About me 
---
<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I am a final year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the areas of computational methods using HPC architechtures. I am currently working as a visiting student researcher at [Computational Reactive Flows and Energy Lab](https://crfel.umn.edu/) in collaboration with [Prof.Suo Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/me/suo-yang), the Univerisity of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Minneapolis, USA. We are working on obtaining fundamental insights on cool/warm flame dynamics under supercritical turbulent conditions using large scale Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) leveraging the [Pele suite of codes](https://amrex-combustion.github.io/). Paralelly, I am also engaged with the [FLAME lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/), Indian Institute of Science, alongside [Prof.Aditya](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/name/konduri-aditya/) on a project involving non-premixed flame dynamics in dual-mode ramjet engines. Previously, I worked on rarefied gas-flows and reacting gas-dynamics with [Prof.Satheesh K](https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/satheeshk) at [Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/aboutus/institute) for 6 months, building [CHEMOC](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/CHEMOC) and [high-temperature EOS solvers](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/High-Temperature-Gas-Dynamics). I am also a freelance CFD code developer and maintain [INTENSE](https://github.com/RSuryaNarayan/INT--E--NSE), a 2-d structured grid Navier-Stokes solver.

## Research Interests
---
I get piqued by:
1. Turbulence- all forms from MHD, reacting flows to simple ones. I love chaos. Period. 
2. Turbulent combustion- algorithm/code development & diagnostics
3. Hypersonic reacting flows - aerothermochemical external flows and scramjet propulsion
4. High-performance computing 
5. Machine Learning on large-scale scientific datasets
6. Reduced order modelling (ROM)
7. Data driven dynamical systems (DDDS) for characterizing turbulent flow fields
8. Quantum computing

## Publications
---
1. Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulent flame-stabilization modes in dual-mode ramjets (in-preparation)
2. Cool/Warm flame dynamics under supercritical turbulent conditions (in-preparation)

TODO: segregate research groups and national lab research. Sort under the following heads:

## Food for thought
1. [Terence Tao's drops of wisdom for life](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/): Tao is the next big guy who managed to get really close to winning the billion dollars for solving the Navier Stokes Equations.
